This repo contains information, files and scripts for replicating and validating analyses on the effect of obesity on the gender-related difference in lung cancer survival, performed by [Alex Ryzhenkov](mailto:alexey.ryzhenkov@helsinki.fi), a PhD student in the iCAN-SHARE group in Helsinki. 

He noted that the worse outcome in males was significantly less apparent in obese patients both in univariate and in multivariate analyses. As this was a pure and simple RWD study, very little information was available on biological determinants and other explanatory factors, but this observation may raise quite a few interesting questions for further experimental and clinical research.

The work was submitted to [JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics](https://ascopubs.org/journal/cci) and while receiving favorable comments, the major criticism was on using single-center data only with no validation (see [ms_comments](./ms_comments)).

For performing the validation, please see the [readiness_package](./readiness_package) and [analysis_package](./analysis_package) folders for details.

The deadline for the revision is Dec 15, and we would hope to get your replication data in by early December 2025.
